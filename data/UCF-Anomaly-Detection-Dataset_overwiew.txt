- Temporal_Anomaly_Annotation.txt     - contains temporal annotations for test videos

Each row of 'Temporal_Anomaly_Annotation.txt' is the annotation for a video, for example:
Abuse028_x264.mp4  Abuse  165  240  -1 -1
-	The first column is the name of the video
-	The second column is the name of the anomalous event
-	The third column is the starting frame of the event (you will have to convert each video to image frames first)
-	The fourth column is the ending frame of the event.
-	For videos in which second  instance of event occurs, fifth and sixth contains starting and ending frames of second instance.
    Negative number means no anomalous event instance. In this example, abuse (instance) only occurs once.

Note: Our videos have 30 frames per second.
